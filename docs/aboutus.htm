                We are pleased that you are interested in our Scouts BSA Troops, and in Scouting in general. Scouting is a 
                tremendous youth development program that; teaches valuable skills, develops new and varied interests, 
                builds leadership in individuals, and creates friendships and memories that will last a lifetime. 
                Scouts Honor! <br><br>

                We have two very active, year-round Scouts BSA Units to serve you:
                <ul>
                  <li>Troop 214B has been serving boys for over 50 years of history and was founded in 1966. Our 
                    membership average over the past several years has been between 30-35 Scouts.</li>
                  <li>Troop 214G has the unique distinction of being the first Scouts BSA troop for girls in Occoneechee 
                    Council founded on February 1, 2019. Our membership average is between 10-15 Scouts.</li>
                </ul>
                We also have Crew 214 where our older youth join to take part in high adventure.<br><br>
                
                The two troops meet on Monday nights each week at Benson Memorial United Methodist Church (BMUMC) in north 
                Raleigh using the Fellowship Hall and Scout Hut. We'll take this opportunity to thank our Benson Memorial 
                United Methodist Church online, as they are a great partner and have provided great support to Troop 214 
                as one of their long-standing youth ministries.<br><br>

              <font face="Arial"> <br>
                <strong>NOTE:</strong> The Scout Hut is at the top of that
                map. You have to drive up a small hill in the BMUMC driveway, then drive around
                back to the Scout Hut.<br><br>

                <strong>NOTE 2:</strong>If you are in the Order of the Arrow, our Kiowa
                chapter also meets at BMUMC in the Fellowship Hall on campus (also on the map).
                Those meetings are on the 2nd Thursday of each month from 7:00pm until 8:00pm.<br><br>
                We camp every month, and attend week-long Scout summer camp every summer.<br><br>

                Our campouts teach outdoor skills and appreciation of natural areas, but also provide advancement
                opportunities and adventure. Some examples of our campouts include; backpacking, caving,
                climbing/rappelling, whitewater rafting, canoeing, kayaking, sailing, scuba
                diving, and anything and everything else the Scouts decide to do in their annual
                planning meetings.<br><br>

                The troops are youth-led, with adults acting in advisory,
                safety, and transportation roles. The adults also have as much fun as the
                youth. We encourage parents to consider a troop role in which they can best use
                their talents and skills to help (i.e., Troop Committee, Assistant Scoutmaster, Patrol
                Advisor, Merit Badge Counselor). It is not required, but working with the
                youth is very rewarding and the more people working with it means a stronger
                and better troop for the youth. <br><br>

                We also provide community service throughout the year, have troop elections twice
                annually, Courts of Honor (awards ceremony) every four months, and go on a variety of day-trips and
                patrol outings annually.<br><br>

                Over 165 Scouts have earned the coveted Eagle rank in Troop 214.
                We don't judge the quality of our troop by that number, but we're proud of every
                one of those individuals. <br><br>

                If you want to learn more, please contact the boys <a
                  href="mailto:scoutmaster@troop-214.org">Scoutmaster</a>
                or <a href="mailto:spl@troop-214.org">Senior Patrol Leader</a> or the girls
                <a href="mailto:sm@troop-214.org">Scoutmaster</a>. Better yet, come visit
                any of our weekly meetings. The weekly troop meetings start at
                7:00pm and end at 8:30pm. We don't meet on a variety of national or school
                holidays, so you should check our online calendar to be sure. Also
                be sure to check out some of our online trip photos to see some of the campouts
                we go on. And if you are brand new to Scouting you should check out
